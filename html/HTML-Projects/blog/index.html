            <h3>How to install a custom rom?</h3>
            <p>To install a custom ROM you should follow these steps</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Unlock your phone's bootloader:</strong></li>
              <p>Bootloader is a specific piece of code on your phone that executes while turning you phone on from switched-off state.It's put it a phone by phone vendor.It may differ from vendor to vendor.
                By unlocking your phone's bootloader you are essentially telling your phone to accept other OS which is not accepted by your phone but still designed for your phone.
                By default your phone's bootloader is locked and won't accept other Operating Systems even if it's designed for your phone it's majorly done to avoid security risks . <br> <br>
                <b>NOTE :</b> Vendors tend to void your warantty if you unlock your bootloader so do it at your own risk.

                <strong>Installing a custom Recovery</strong>
              </li>
              <p>
                Custom Recovery are Special Software that are made especially for your phone to modify your phone software. When installing a custom recovery you must check if it's made for your phone else 
                your phone can get soft bricked(i.e get in a boot look) or <b>hard bricked</b>(i.e Phone won't turn on at all).Some popular custom revoery softawres are TWRP, OrangeFox recovery, Lineage OS Recovery etc
                This is like a entrypoint to install a new OS to your Phone with a major hassel.

                <strong> Find a Custom ROM</strong>
              </li>
               <p>
                 if you are just getting into the custom ROM space finding a custom ROM might be abit tricky.
                 If you have a really popular phone you might find a custom ROM on youtube for your phone but don't get disappointed if you don't find it on first go.
                 For most phones there are forums you can find on somewhere like XDA developers but for some phones you might need to dig in a bit more.
                 These days telegram is pretty much a goto platform for custom ROMs ,it's the one I recommend getting into the most.
                 There can be many telegram groups/communitues in telegram depending upon your phone its mainly run by developers ,enthusiasts and users just like you.
                 People there are mostly helpful too. In most leegram groups they have MODDED and ported ROMs.
                 </p>
                <li><b>Install Custom ROM :</b></li>
                <p>
                  Installing a custom ROM is a fun and easy part. It should only take from 5 to 10 minutes depending upon the storage spec of your phone.
                  If it's taking longer you might have not followed the above steps clearly.
                  But most custom ROMs have good error handling meaning when you try to install it into the wrong phone it won't proceed further giving you a 
                  clear error message.
